# Exploring Connecticutâ€™s Pretrial Inmate Data

- `ct_inmates_descriptives.Rmd` does all the analysis and visualization; it generates all the `png` images in `graphs`
- The notebook calls `ct.csv`, which is the 7-28-19 downloaded version of [this spreadsheet via CT Open Data](https://data.ct.gov/Public-Safety/Accused-Pre-Trial-Inmates-in-Correctional-Faciliti/b674-jy6w)
    - The `csv` is too large to live on Github, but thankfully you can download the current one and subset dates to 1-8-19 if you want to exactly replicate my work
